# Data Handling and Management

Context API:
The Context API is used to manage the global state of the cart and wishlist across the entire application. This allows components like Cart, Wishlist, and ProductDetail to share data without the need for prop drilling.
The cart and wishlist data are passed through context to allow for easy management and updating.

LocalStorage:
LocalStorage is used to persist data like the cart and wishlist between page reloads. When the user adds an item to the cart, the data is stored in LocalStorage, so it's accessible on future visits. This ensures the cart's state is preserved even after a page refresh.
